# 2DMagic
2D game engine - kind of thing

2DMagic (ye I didn't wanna waste time thinking about a random pokemon name) is a really small 2D game engine built upon SDL.
The whole purpose of this project is just learning and having fun, so probably you dont want to use this engine to create your next AAA 2D game.

I've been experiencing with some of the smaller features of the a 2D engine, so far I implemented:

:white_check_mark: Basic ECS system

:white_check_mark: Basic Sprite system

:white_check_mark: Keyboard controller (hardcoded at the moment)

:white_check_mark: Basic collision detection - with tags (AABB)

:white_check_mark: Map rendering from a .map - file

:white_check_mark: Camera following the player

In the future I plan to work on:

:black_square_button: Basic Sprite system

:black_square_button: Basic Particle system

:black_square_button: Some basic built in AI

:black_square_button: Better collision detection

:black_square_button: Ray tracing to burn 3k cards
