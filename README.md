# 2DMagic
2D game engine - kind of thing

2DMagic (I chose a simple name because, let's be honest, who has time for coming up with a random Pok√©mon name?) is this tiny 2D game engine I put together back in my UNI days using SDL. It's not meant for creating the next big 2D blockbuster; I mainly built it to learn and have some fun.

I've been experiencing with some of the smaller features of the a 2D engine, so far I implemented:

:white_check_mark: Basic ECS system

:white_check_mark: Basic Sprite system

:white_check_mark: Keyboard controller (hardcoded at the moment)

:white_check_mark: Basic collision detection - with tags (AABB)

:white_check_mark: Map rendering from a .map - file

:white_check_mark: Camera following the player

In the future I plan to work on:

:black_square_button: Basic Sprite system

:black_square_button: Basic Particle system

:black_square_button: Some basic built in AI

:black_square_button: Better collision detection

:black_square_button: Ray tracing to burn 3k cards
